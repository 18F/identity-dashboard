    intro_html: "This partner portal is where you will manage your Login.gov integrations for testing and production. Before you start creating an integration, review our <a href='https://developers.login.gov/' class='usa-link'>developer docs</a> to understand any requirements. If you have any questions, reach out to our engineers through the <a href='https://gsa.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CG64NU5C7' class='usa-link'>Partner Slack Channel</a> or submit a support ticket through the <a href='https://zendesk.login.gov' class='usa-link'>partner support help desk</a>."
    issuer_html: "This is a unique string to identify the app in the IdP, and is also used as the <code>client_id</code>.

    logo: Your logo will appear in the top banner when users arrive at the Login.gov sign in page from your application. A logo file is required for production applications. We accept both SVGs and PNGs but the file size is limited to 50kB.
    logo_html: Choose a file to upload as your logo. Your file should follow <a href='https://developers.login.gov/user-experience/agency-logo/'>our guidelines</a>."
    logo_input: Logo file type must be SVG or PNG
    cert_input: Upload your PEM encoded public certificate
    save_new: Create app
    save_existing: Update app
    certificate: Your public certificate (or certificates), which contains your public key. Needed for OpenID Connect (when using private_key_jwt) and for SAML. Optional for OIDC PKCE.
    certificate_html: This certificate can be generated using the <a href='https://developers.login.gov/testing/#creating-a-public-certificate' class='usa-link'>OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed cert</a>. Self-signed certs should be for testing/sandbox purposes only. The public key is part of the public certificate, which you may see referenced in other parts of the documentation. We recommend using Certificate Authority (CA) issued certificates for your production integration.</p><p class='usa-hint'>The command also generates a corresponding private key — keep this private and <strong>do not lose it</strong>.</p><p class='usa-hint'>To simplify the complexity of rotation, Login.gov does not check certificate expiration dates. At this time, new certificates are not deployed to production automatically — <a href='https://developers.login.gov/production/#certificate-rotation-process' class='usa-link'>follow our certificate rotation procedure documented here</a>.</p><p class='usa-hint'>We do not delete old certificates from the database even if you remove them from the portal. You must request their deletion through the Partner Support Help Desk.

    public_certificate_oidc_html: You can upload as many certificates to your application as you desire but only one will be used at a time. At minimum for OIDC, you must ensure that your authentication request is signed with the private key.</p><p class='usa-hint'>Note that we do not support separate signing and encryption certificates.
    public_certificate_saml_html: You can upload as many certificates to your application as you desire but only one will be used at a time.</p><p class='usa-hint'>For SAML, you must also implement encryption. Make sure you use the new private key that was generated with your certificate for decryption or you will be unable to decrypt the response.</p><p class='usa-hint'>Note that we do not support separate signing and encryption certificates.
    assertion_consumer_service_url_html: After the user authenticates, Login.gov will redirect and POST a form back to this URL. See our <a href= 'https://developers.login.gov/saml/authentication/#authentication-response' target='_blank' class='usa-link'>SAML authentication response documentation</a> for more information.
    assertion_consumer_logout_service_url_html: After receiving the <a href='https://developers.login.gov/saml/logout/#logout-request' target='_blank' class='usa-link'>logout request</a> from your application, Login.gov will redirect and POST a form back to this URL. See our <a href='https://developers.login.gov/saml/logout/#logout-response' class='usa-link'>SAML logout response documentation</a> for more information.
    sp_initiated_login_url: The endpoint which initializes authentication with Login.gov. The SP-initiated sign-in flow begins by generating a SAML authentication request that gets redirected to Login.gov. This flow is useful for when a user tries to access a protected resource within your application directly.
    saml_assertion_encryption: Whether to encrypt SAML assertions sent to your SP. If set to AES, authentication assertions received at your ACS URL will be encrypted with the public key specified above. If set to none, assertions will be protected only by HTTPS. Production applications must have assertion encryption turned on.
    saml_assertion_encryption_html: The type of encryption you have enabled for your application. If set to AES, authentication assertions received from your Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL will be encrypted with the public certificate/key you added in the Logo and Certificate step.</p><p class='usa-hint'><strong>Production applications must have encryption turned on for security purposes.</strong> When turned off, assertions are only protected by HTTPS.</p><p class='usa-hint'><strong>Please contact us via the Partner Help Desk if you want to turn assertion encryption off.</strong>
    signed_response_requested: Select 'yes' if you want your application to receive a signed SAML authentication response form Login.gov to verify that the response is authentic and has not been tampered with.
    return_to_app_url_html: "Login.gov will redirect users to this URL when they wish to go back to your application after a recent login or canceling out of an in-progress authentication.</p><p class='usa-hint'> For example: <code>https://app.agency.gov</code>"
    failure_to_proof_url: The URL provided to users who are unable to complete identity proofing and returning to your application.
    post_idv_follow_up_url: The URL provided to users who have completed identity verification but have not returned to your application. This URL should provide a prompt for user's to sign in.
    push_notification_url: Your application's endpoint which receives push notifications.
    push_notification_url_html: To receive security event notifications you must provide a push notification destination URL when Login.gov can send these events as they occur. <a href='https://developers.login.gov/security-events/' class='usa-link'>Learn more information about our security events</a>.
    redirect_uris_oidc_html: "One or more URIs that Login.gov will redirect to after authentication. Login.gov will only redirect to URIs listed here. These can be web URLs (public, internal, or localhost) or a custom scheme to support native applications, for example: <code>gov.agency.app://result</code>.

    attribute_bundle_info_html: The default attributes that Login.gov will return to your application during authentication. Refer to our <a href='https://developers.login.gov/attributes/'>developer docs</a> for the possible user attributes available at each IAL level that can be requested by your app.
