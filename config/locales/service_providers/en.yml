        has_script_tag: "The logo file you uploaded (%{filename}) contains one or more script tags. Please remove all script tags and re-upload"
    app_name_html: "The application name listed in your signed <a href='https://developers.login.gov/production/#confirm-interagency-agreement-iaa'>Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA)</a> with Login.gov. Ask your Login.gov Account Manager if you aren't sure what this is."
    friendly_name: The name displayed to users when they arrive at the Login.gov sign in page from your application.
    description: This is only visible to members of your team in the portal. It is helpful to further describe the team's applications. For example, if this is intended for testing, you could put "Testing Environment Configuration" so you can distinguish the environments for your applications.
    team: All members of your team will be able to access your application configuration.
    protocol: This is the authentication protocol used by the service provider. We highly recommend using OpenID Connect unless a technical reason prevents you.
    protocol_html: Please review the <a href='https://developers.login.gov/oidc/getting-started/' class='usa-link'>OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) and <a href='https://developers.login.gov/saml/getting-started/' class='usa-link'>SAML</a> pages in the developer docs before making this selection. The protocol you choose will determine how you structure the requests made to Login.gov. Note that we recommend using OIDC because SAML is significantly more difficult to set up.
    identity_protocol_html: Please review the <a href='https://developers.login.gov/oidc/getting-started/' class='usa-link'>OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) and <a href='https://developers.login.gov/saml/getting-started/' class='usa-link'>SAML</a> pages in the developer docs before making this selection. The protocol you choose will determine how you structure the requests made to Login.gov. Note that we recommend using OIDC because SAML is significantly more difficult to set up.

    before_start_1_html: "Once you complete this form, your testing integration will be automatically deployed in our sandbox environment, not the production environment. All new configurations or configuration changes must be promoted to production following the <a href='https://developers.login.gov/production' class='usa-link'>process outlined in the Login.gov Developer Docs</a>. Configurations must be reviewed and approved by the Login.gov Partnerships team. Changes to production apps are not automatic and can take up to two weeks."

Before you start creating an integration, review our <a href='https://developers.login.gov/' class='usa-link'>developer docs</a> to understand any requirements. If you have any questions, reach out to our engineers through the <a href='https://gsa.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CG64NU5C7' class='usa-link'>Partner Slack Channel</a> or submit a support ticket through the <a href='https://zendesk.login.gov' class='usa-link'>partner support help desk</a>."

    certificate: "Your public certificate (or certificates), which contains your public key. Needed for OpenID Connect (when using private_key_jwt) and for SAML. Optional for OIDC PKCE."
    certificate_html: This certificate can be generated using the <a href="https://developers.login.gov/testing/#creating-a-public-certificate">OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed cert</a>. Self-signed certs should be for testing/sandbox purposes only. The public key is part of the public certificate, which you may see referenced in other parts of the documentation. We recommend using Certificate Authority (CA) issued certificates for your production integration.</p><p class='usa-hint'>The command also generates a corresponding private key — keep this private and <strong>do not lose it</strong>.</p><p class='usa-hint'>To simplify the complexity of rotation, Login.gov does not check certificate expiration dates. At this time, new certificates are not deployed to production automatically — <a href='https://developers.login.gov/production/#certificate-rotation-process'>follow our certificate rotation procuedure documented here</a>.</p><p class='usa-hint'>We do not delete old certificates from the database even if you remove them from the portal. You must request their deletion through the Partner Support Help Desk.
    certificate_example_html: <p class="usa-hint">Certificate must be PEM encoded, like this example:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<br />MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAJC1HiIAZAiIMA0GCSqGSIb3Df<br />BAYTAkFVMRMwEQYDVQQIDApTb21lLVN0YXRlMSEwHwYDVx<br />B7xxt8BVc69rHV15A0qyx77CLSj3tCx2IUXVqRs5mlvA==<br />-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code></pre>
