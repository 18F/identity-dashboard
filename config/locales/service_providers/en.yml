    logo: Your logo will appear in the top banner when users arrive at the Login.gov sign in page from your application. A logo file is required for production applications. We accept both SVGs and PNGs but the file size is limited to 50kB.

    certificate: Your public certificate (or certificates), which contains your public key. Needed for OpenID Connect (when using private_key_jwt) and for SAML. Optional for OIDC PKCE.
    certificate_html: This certificate can be generated using the <a href='/documentation?destination=testing/#creating-a-public-certificate' target='_blank' class='usa-link usa-link--external'>OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed cert</a>. Self-signed certs should be for testing/sandbox purposes only. The public key is part of the public certificate, which you may see referenced in other parts of the documentation. We recommend using Certificate Authority (CA) issued certificates for your production integration.</p><p class='usa-hint'>The command also generates a corresponding private key — keep this private and <strong>do not lose it</strong>.</p><p class='usa-hint'>To simplify the complexity of rotation, Login.gov does not check certificate expiration dates.

At minimum for OIDC, you must ensure that your authentication request is signed with the private key.</p><p class='usa-hint'>Note that we do not support separate signing and encryption certificates.
    public_certificate_saml_html: You can upload as many certificates to your configuration as you desire but only one will be used at a time.</p><p class='usa-hint'>For SAML, you must also implement encryption.

    assertion_consumer_service_url_html: After the user authenticates, Login.gov will redirect and POST a form back to this URL.

    sp_initiated_login_url: The endpoint which initializes authentication with Login.gov. The SP-initiated sign-in flow begins by generating a SAML authentication request that gets redirected to Login.gov. This flow is useful for when a user tries to access a protected resource within your application directly.
    saml_assertion_encryption: Whether to encrypt SAML assertions sent to your SP. If set to AES, authentication assertions received at your ACS URL will be encrypted with the public key specified above. If set to none, assertions will be protected only by HTTPS. Production integrations must have assertion encryption turned on.
    saml_assertion_encryption_html: The type of encryption you have enabled for your configuration. If set to AES, authentication assertions received from your Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL will be encrypted with the public certificate/key you added in the Logo and Certificate step.</p><p class='usa-hint'><strong>Production integrations must have encryption turned on for security purposes.</strong> When turned off, assertions are only protected by HTTPS.</p><p class='usa-hint'><strong>Please contact us via the Partner Help Desk if you want to turn assertion encryption off.</strong>
    signed_response_requested: Select 'yes' if you want your application to receive a signed SAML authentication response form Login.gov to verify that the response is authentic and has not been tampered with.
